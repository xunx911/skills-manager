> ⛔ **ONE TASK PER INVOCATION** — Complete one task from @.agent/tasks.json, commit, output `<promise>TASK-{ID}:DONE</promise>`, and STOP. Do NOT start the next task. Do NOT use parallel agents for multiple tasks.

## Overview

You are implementing the project described in @.agent/prd/SUMMARY.md

## Required Setup

This repository is split into a Python API and a Next.js web app.

- API source: `apps/api`
- Web source: `apps/web`
- One-command dev server from repo root: `bash scripts/dev.sh`
- App URL: http://localhost:3000/skills

Use these verification commands:

- Backend tests: `cd apps/api && uv run pytest`
- Web typecheck: `cd apps/web && npm run typecheck`
- Web build: `cd apps/web && npm run build`
- Web E2E: `cd apps/web && npm run e2e`

## Before Starting

Check @.agent/STEERING.md for critical work. Complete items in sequence, remove when done. Only proceed to implement tasks if no critical work pending.

## Task Flow

Tasks are listed in @.agent/tasks.json

1. Pick highest-priority task with `passes: false` in `tasks.json`
2. Read full spec: `.agent/tasks/TASK-${ID}.json`
3. Check existing dir structure in @.agent/STRUCTURE.md
4. Implement step by step according to the task spec and write focused tests
5. **UI tasks only:** do a Playwright smoke test
   - Check console for errors
   - Write minimal e2e test (happy path only)
   - Skip e2e if unit test already covers functionality
   - Save UI Screenshot to `.agent/screenshots/TASK-${ID}-{index}.png`, verify UI correctness. If debugging, use previous screenshots as reference.
6. Run the verification commands listed in the task spec.
7. For full-stack changes, run backend tests, web typecheck, web build, and web E2E.
8. All tests must pass. Broke unrelated test? Fix it before proceeding.
9. When tests pass, set `passes: true` in `tasks.json` for the task you completed.
10. Log entry → `.agent/logs/LOG.md` (date, brief summary, screenshot path, newest at the top)
11. Update `.agent/STRUCTURE.md` if dirs changed. Exclude dotfiles, tests and config.
12. Commit changes, using the Conventional Commit format.

## Rules

- **CRITICAL**: Only work on **ONE task per invocation**. After committing the task, output `<promise>TASK-{ID}:DONE</promise>` and **STOP immediately**. Do NOT read the next task. Do NOT continue working. Your response **must END** after the promise tag. Any output after it is a violation.
- Kill all background processes (dev server, etc.) before outputting the promise tag.
- No git init/remote changes. **No git push**.
- Product/spec/plan/audit/README documentation must be written in Chinese.
- Check the last 5 tasks in `.agent/logs/LOG.md` for past work
- **CRITICAL**: When **ALL** tasks pass → output `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` and **nothing else**.

## Help Tags

Try solving tasks yourself first.
When stuck after all possible solutions exhausted, output one of the following tags:

1. **BLOCKED** — technical issues: Playwright broken, dev server not working, deps won't install, env issues, no network, service outages, invalid/missing credentials. Output:

```
<promise>BLOCKED:brief description</promise>
```

**Exit immediately (no workarounds) for environment constraints you cannot fix from inside the sandbox:**

- `Blocked by network policy` → firewall, only user can change from host
- Missing/invalid credentials or API keys
- Required system service unavailable
- Hardware/arch incompatibility with no known fix

These are not bugs. No amount of retries, alternative downloads, or package managers will help. Output BLOCKED on first failure.

2. **DECIDE** — need human input: lib choices, architecture, unclear requirements, breaking changes. Output:

```
<promise>DECIDE:question (Option A vs B)</promise>
```
